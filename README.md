# UPKEEP SENTRY
Upkeep Sentry is a program that is meant to replace uptimerobot  
Upkeep Sentry is meant for upkeeping repl servers (so if you have a fileserver or a minecraft server running on replit it will upkeep with just a small 24/7 server at your home)
# USAGE
just run the `main.py` file and input the amount of servers to upkeep and their ips/domains (EX example.example.repl.co as a domain and 1.16.123.56:6000 as an ip)
